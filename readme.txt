To get started copy all files into a folder on your computer and run Ogawa.exe (requires MCR2015b)

Ogawa can be used to sort high density grids very quickly. 
The app uses the ROI of sort-bucket 1. This means that you 
need to have selected a ROI to sort and have placed it in the 
left most population to sort in the sort layout window in Sortware. 
The app moves the deflected stream in increments subtracting the voltage, 
i.e. the stream will move in increments to the left once started, 
follwed by down in the Y direction, and subsequently in the X direction 
if chosen.
(1) Have Sortware connected, and acquiring data.
(2) Ensure you have selected the population that you want sorted as the left most population to be sorted in the sort layout.
(3) Adjust the stream deflection voltage to be where you want the first drop to go. The next drop will go left of this.
(4) Configure sort grid as desired in the Ogawa window and click start!.
